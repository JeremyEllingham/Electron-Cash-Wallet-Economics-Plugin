# Electron Cash Wallet Economics Plugin

This plugin shows a couple key wallet economics stats.

Its aim is to help people drop fiat and use BCH instead, by alleviating following issues:

1. marketing - by being able to demonstrate how much profit one gains by switching from fiat to bch as a primary currency.
2. volatility - by being able to easily see if it is time to accumulate (negative unrealized profit) or spend.
3. merchant inflows - by increasing the amount of consumers holding BCH for the purpose of spending.  



The plugin is not intended to calculate profit for tax purposes.

## Troubleshooting

Note: The Wallet Economics tab will appear blank if you do not have fiat currency values enabled.  To do so, `Tools > Preferences > Fiat > Ensure "Show history rates" checkbox is ticked`. Then restart your Electron Cash, and you should see Fiat values on the History page, and values will then load on your Wallet Economics tab.
